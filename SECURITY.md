# ROOMRESERVE MERN App Security Policy

Last updated: January 8, 2024

## Purpose

The purpose of this security policy is to establish and maintain a secure development and operational environment for the ROOMRESERVE MERN App. This policy outlines the security practices and measures to protect against unauthorized access, data breaches, and other potential security threats.

## Scope

This security policy applies to all contributors, developers, administrators, and users involved in the development, deployment, and maintenance of the ROOMRESERVE MERN App.

## Information Security Responsibilities

1. **Developers and Contributors:**
    - Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and cross-site request forgery (CSRF).
    - Regularly review and update dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.
    - Report any identified security vulnerabilities or concerns promptly to the designated security contact.

2. **Administrators:**
    - Implement access controls to restrict unauthorized access to sensitive information and system resources.
    - Monitor system logs for suspicious activities and promptly investigate and mitigate any identified security incidents.
    - Keep server infrastructure and dependencies up-to-date with security patches.

3. **Users:**
    - Protect and keep confidential any login credentials and sensitive information provided for local development and testing purposes.
    - Report any suspicious activities or security concerns to the administrators.

## Access Controls

1. **User Authentication:**
    - Use strong, unique passwords for user accounts.
    - Implement multi-factor authentication where possible.

2. **Authorization:**
    - Limit access to system resources based on the principle of least privilege.
    - Regularly review and update access permissions for users based on their roles.

## Data Protection

1. **Data Encryption:**
    - Implement encryption for sensitive data in transit using secure protocols such as HTTPS.
    - Encrypt sensitive data at rest, including database contents.

2. **User Credentials:**
    - Store user credentials securely using industry-standard hashing algorithms.
    - Do not store sensitive information, such as passwords, in plaintext.

3. **Data Backups:**
    - Regularly backup application data and ensure that backups are stored securely.
    - Test data restoration processes to ensure the availability of backups in case of data loss.

## Incident Response

1. **Incident Reporting:**
    - Report any security incidents or breaches promptly to the designated security contact.

2. **Investigation and Mitigation:**
    - Conduct thorough investigations of security incidents and implement necessary corrective actions to prevent recurrence.

## Secure Development Practices

1. **Code Review:**
    - Conduct regular code reviews to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

2. **Dependency Management:**
    - Regularly review and update third-party dependencies to address known security vulnerabilities.

3. **Security Testing:**
    - Implement automated security testing, including static analysis and penetration testing, as part of the development lifecycle.

## Compliance

1. **Legal and Regulatory Compliance:**
    - Comply with relevant data protection and privacy laws and regulations.

2. **Third-Party Services:**
    - Ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of third-party services used in the application.

## Revision and Review

This security policy will be reviewed regularly to ensure its effectiveness and relevance. Any updates or changes to the security policy will be communicated to all relevant stakeholders.

By participating in the development, deployment, or use of the ROOMRESERVE MERN App, all stakeholders agree to adhere to the provisions outlined in this security policy. Failure to comply with this policy may result in disciplinary action, including revocation of access privileges and legal consequences.
